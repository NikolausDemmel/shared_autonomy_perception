As the directory name suggests, this contains example/testing/random code in ipython notebook format. If running ipython locally, I recomment `ipython notebook inline`. Best viewed online using nbviewer:

* http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SharedAutonomyToolkit/shared_autonomy_perception/blob/master/random_snippets/testing_assemble_kinect.ipynb (as the name suggests ... tests assemble_kinect and some basic image manipulation)
